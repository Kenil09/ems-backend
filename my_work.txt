Admin will assign task to user
user will complete his task by giving proof of task and ask for any further query if he have about task
If not then they add proof of completion on that task

{
    assigned  ->
    assignee  ->
    dead_line ->
    Notify People Before One Day of their dead_line will gonna be completing ->
    submission_files -> [array_of_files] // we'll put that into s3 bucket named ems_submission_files with task_id as folder and filenames as per that
    If dead_line is passed -> then give reason for that
    give employee rating on that task -> From 1 to 5
    state: ['assigned', 'completed']
}
    If employee getting 5 star rating overall month then they considered as 5 star employee of the week
